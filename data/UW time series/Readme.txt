UW Covid Time Series Tables
This directory will contain the files generated by CaseCounter from the full JHU Case Dataset

JHU files are copied to COVID19DataAnalysis daily to data/COVID-19/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports

The BuildLibrary routine creates the full set of time series files,  which should be put in the Global directory.   

The directory TestData is ignored by git and can be used for testing.
